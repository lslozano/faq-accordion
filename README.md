## My process

1.- First step was to review the design and what I needed to bring to life.

2.- I then started with a mental model on how the DOM structure would look like.

3.- From there I proceeded to reset the CSS and create the basic DOM structure. For this step, I began my journey on researching how to create an accordion component without the need of JavaScript, and found out about the Details tag.

4.- Now that I had found the Details tag, I started reading and researching about it. When that was done, I created a very basic accordion, just to get the hang of it. Once this was done I moved to styling.

5.- Working on styles entailed going for a mobile first approach, from a broader perspective to polish. First layout, then the styling of the accordion, colors, fonts, spaces, active states. Once that was done, I moved on to the animation process.

6.- Finally, I went on to polish the project, adding some extra features like error handling.
